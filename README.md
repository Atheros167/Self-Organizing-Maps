# Self-Organizing-Maps


  1. Self Organizing Map is a powerful yet simple Unsupervised algorithm that can be used for a variety of applications.

  2. One of the common application for SOM is to take in un-labelled input data and convert that into a low dimensional, discretized classification of the input data.

  3. It looks in an input data with many many variables and reduces it.
  
  4. It is a type of Artificial Neural network that combines many layers with back propagation to continously correct the mapping leading to a more and more accurate map of the data.
  
  5. It is a great way of understanding some of the un-realized correlations in the data and produce some really awesome maps of the data.

  6. In this project, we would be taking a look at a random bank's customer information applying for a credit card. THe variables correspond to the information a customer provides during the application.
  
          ** The goal is to identify which customer cheated. **
  
          ** Since this is an unsupervised deep learning model, we do not have a label or a target variable **
